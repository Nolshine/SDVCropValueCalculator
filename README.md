# SDVCropValueCalculator
A calculator for Stardew Valley that takes in information about the player's current situation and informs them which crop they could potentially make the most money with before the end of the season.
It's still not feature complete, but it also isn't meant to be super complex and allow you to make complicated crop planning choices.

## Gettings And Using The Calculator

### Getting it
You will be able to get it in the near future as I will put up a release here on the repo.

### Using it
It's really simple; the program is essentially a form that takes a few datails about your current game state:
* The amount of gold you have available
* The day in the season you're currently on
* The season you're currently in
Once those are filled in, click the 'Calculate' button, and a list of up to three crops, in descending order of preference, will be displayed to you.
So just go and buy the closest crop to the top crop that you can, and buy as much of it as you can!
Note that this tool doesn't take into account growth speed modifiers yet.
It also doesn't take into account festivals, (although I've not yet run into a festival I couldn't do work on, so just get the seeds in advance and you'll be fine).
